# Cookiecutter Django Base Template

This is a base template for Django projects. It includes some common configurations and tools to help you get started quickly.

This template is based on a lot of good ideas and layout from the [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) project, but stripped down to the bare essentials and simplified to use as a base for any Django project.
